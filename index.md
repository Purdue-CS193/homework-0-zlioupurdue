# Zi-He(Johnnie) Liou's First CS193 Homework :D

Things I like about CS19300
- I can use github for the first time (I'm very concerned about my future as a CS major lol)
- I like the pacing of the class
- I can eat cookies (none of you saw that)

*__This is just like the markdown stuff on Discord__*

I don't like green
